#SW 2nd Program Design notes


#What is the software development life cycle?
  #It is the Cycle that is used to slowly but surely solve problems
#What are the steps in the software development life cycle?
  #1:requirements analisys (what needs to happen) 
  # 2:Planning (Designating jobs) 
  # 3:Write the code 
  # 4:Testing(finding the errors and fix them)
  # 5:Maintenance and release(more debugging!)
#Why do we use the software development life cycle?
  #It is found to be a very effective method for making and fixing your code
#What are the 3 types of bugs that are most likely to occur in a program?
  #Syntax
  #Run-time
  #Logic 
#Where do each of these bugs come from?
  #The code pieces don't interact as you expected 
  #Issue that happens while the code is running/being compiled
  #incorrect reasoning/design flaws
#How do we resolve each type of bug?
  #by finding where and why an issue happened and fixing it
  #check the software/hardware you are running it on
  #fixing the logic/reasoning
#What is debugging?
  #The act of fixing problems in code
#Why do I need to be comfortable with debugging? 
  #Because the majority of time spent coding is debugging
