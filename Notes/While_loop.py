#SW 2nd While Loop Notes


#What is a while loop?
    #a loop that runs indenfinitly while a statement is true
#How are while loops different from for loops?
    #while runs until the statement is false or is broken while a for statement runs until it runs a cirtain amout of times  
#Why do we need a counter in a while loop?
    #it acts as an iterator
#What is a break statement?
    #a statement the bypasses the statement needing to be false to just end the loop immediately
#How do we use an else statement with a while loop?
    #by putting it below and it will activate when the loop ends
#Does a break statement let the else statement happen?
    #no it doesn't
#What does continue do?
    #it starts you at the begining of the while loop
