#SW 2nd Function Notes



#What is the purpose of a function?
    #to accomplish a task more easily

#How do you write functions?
player_hp=1

def attack(dmg):
    return player_hp-dmg

#Why should functions be abstract?
    #So that they can apply to as many things as possible so they can simplify things as much as possible to make your code more modular

#how do functions increase readability of a program?
    # they allow people to see your thought process and make connections on what things do

#what does modularity have to do with functions?
    #Functions help make your code more modular by compacting it

#How do arguments and parameters work together?
    #paramaters is the stuff in the parenthesis when the function is defined and arguements are the inputs that are put in place of the parameters

#What are return statements? What do they do?
    #the return stements are the outputs of the function and make the function do things

#What is the scope of a variable?
    #the scope of the variable is where the variable can be used; if it's local its scope is the function it is assigned to;if it's global it can be accessed from anywhere. 

#How are local and global variables different?
    #local variables are only inside functions while global variables canbe accessed from anywhere

#Why is it bad practice to make changes to global variables inside a function?
    # because it can cause problems outside of the function
