#SW 2nd Elif and Logical operators notes



#How do we check more than one condition in python?
  #by using elif
#How many else if statements can you create? 
  #as many as you want
#Why does the order of your statements matter in a conditional?
  #so that there aren't any values that slip through the cracks
#How do we use boolean instead of boolean statements? 
homework=False
chores=True

if homework and chores:
    print("you can can go to your friends hosuse")
elif not chores:
    print("Go do your chores")
else:
    print("Do your homework")
#What are the logical operators?
  #and(CHECKS MULTIPLE CONDITIONS)/not(CHECKS IF CONDITION IS FALSE)/or(CHECKS IF ONE OF THE CONDITIONS IS TRUE)
#How are logical operators used to change the outcome of a condition?
  #NOT can reverse it, AND can make a condtion more complex, OR makes a condtion have more ways to activate
#What does pass do?
  #pass is for filling in outputs for conditions
